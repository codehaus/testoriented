#summary Explains how the source control is connected to the issue tracker
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
In order to better trace commits in source control back to [http://code.google.com/p/testoriented/issues/list issues], some properties have been added to folders.  Together, they implement the [http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/docs/40/Articles/SourceControl/TortoiseSVN.html Subversion integration with an issue tracker] as described in the !FogBugz documentation.


= How to use =
If you are using [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN], then you'll get an extra input text box when trying to commit, prompting you for an issue number.

If not, you can instead add the string *Issue:*, followed by a space and the issue number for which the commit is related to the change log.
