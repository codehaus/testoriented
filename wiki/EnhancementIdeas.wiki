It would be nice to have the editor's context menu be more similar to that illustrated in the following  screenshot of [http://www.testdriven.net/ TestDriven.NET]:

...as TODD's functionality is currently:
 # a sub-menu (partially fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/testoriented/issues/detail?id=1 issue 1])
 # ...that's nowhere near the top
 # ...and is not attainable through keyboard shortcuts (partially fixed by [http://code.google.com/p/testoriented/issues/detail?id=1 issue 1])
...as illustrated in the following screenshot:

== Raw Ideas taken from the paper ==

More appropriate user-interface triggers could also be researched, such as exposing TODD’s test-generation functionality through the Eclipse JDT quick-assist extensions, since the test generation is indeed sensitive to context. Such quick-assist functionality may also be able to detect if tests have already been written for the method currently under consideration – thus allowing users to navigate to the tests – as well as determining what new tests would need to be written to verify recently-performed functionality changes or additions. 

It may even be possible to integrate the capabilities of Testar in determining the set of unit tests to re-run as a result of changing some of the source code.
